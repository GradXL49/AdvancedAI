Grady Landers; Advanced AI Project; GAN for image generation using MNIST and KMNIST

Run training.py to generate Generator and Discriminator models. Swap lines 43, 49, 95 and 96
with the commented code on the same line to switch between training on MNIST or KMNIST

Run testing.py to generate examples and test them on the discriminator model. Replace lines
12 and 14 with the commented code on the same line to switch between MNIST and KMNIST models.
Change the value of n on line 23 to set the number of test batches to perform in one run and
change the value of batch_size on line 24 to change the number of generated images in each batch.
